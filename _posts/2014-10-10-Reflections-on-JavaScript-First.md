[These students](https://github.com/orgs/TheIronYard--Orlando/teams/FEE--2014--FALL/) are amazing. They've already learned more `git` and Github workflows than most of the developers I've worked with in the last 10 years. Now we're two weeks into JavaScript, and they're wrestling with [Object-Oriented Programming concepts](http://j.mp/110vBGL)...! By the end of next week, they'll have touched Procedural, OO, and Functional Programming...

I'm very encouraged by how well the class has united in the last three weeks. We kicked the social events off with a bi-weekly movie night (and Friday Iron Pints, of course), and now some of the them are organizing their own game night. They really enjoy being in the class together, and HipChat is always ablaze with chatter from one or more of them working through a problem. What a great cohort!
