### Reflecting on Week 1 at The Iron Yard

Having fun, but I'm off-script for sure. Everyone else has been teaching HTML and CSS for the first two weeks with a crash course on essential `git` commands, while I've been focused entirely on `git`, Github, and Github Pages for the first week. Consequently, the Github Pages that my students have produced pale in comparison to the elusive "Surf and Paddle" assignment (which I found thanks to Justin).

This week, I plan to introduce the class to JavaScript this week with Test-Driven Development, starting with reading examples and working quickly to Coding Dojo examples. We'll start with the String Calculator problem together and work our way towards Conway's Game of Life.

  * Writing advanced JavaScript:
    * in class: String Calculator
    * lab: String Calculator to 1000
