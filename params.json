{"name":"AL the X","tagline":"Who is this guy?","body":"## **AL the X** is the unique pseudonym of [David Rogers](http://j.mp/al_the_x--about), a community organizer & nerd wrangler, instructional speaker, freelance software developer, and dad in Orlando, Florida, USA.\r\n\r\n> I help build the internet everyday using the power of my mind, a lot of typing, and copious handshakes and conversations. Swearing occasionally helps. I help organize nerds, run community events, and teach people. Sometimes I make money while doing it. Sometimes.\r\n\r\nFor more information about me, you can check out [the many public profiles of \"AL the X\"](http://j.mp/al_the_x) courtesy of Bitly. If you [sign-up for my mailing list](http://lb.benchmarkemail.com//listbuilder/signupnew?MBcaF0TGVUX3CPwOvwWDPxBOtDtY377cm%252Bhl%252BCfB5xD5mj5OqPbK3uMzIjNtMjwz), I'll send you regular updates from [my training courses](http://j.mp/just-enough-academy) and [my blog](http://j.mp/mixnutfarm). \r\n\r\n#### If you would like my help _right now_: \r\n\r\n* [ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intents/user?screen_name=al_the_x)\r\n* [schedule some time on clarity.fm](http://j.mp/al_the_x--clarity)\r\n\r\n### Some groups that I help organize:\r\n\r\n* [Orlando PHP](http://orlandophp.org) | [(github)](http://github.com/orlandophp)\r\n* [Orlando Python](http://orlandopy.org)\r\n* [Orlando Dojo](http://orlandodojo.org) | [(github)](http://github.com/orlandodojo)\r\n\r\n### Classes that I teach:\r\n\r\n* [Valencia Digital Media](http://valenciadigitalmedia.com) | [(github)](https://github.com/valencia-digital-media)\r\n  * [DIG1102C - Intro to Programming with JavaScript](http://vcc-dig1102.github.io/) | [(github)](https://github.com/vcc-dig1102/)\r\n  * [DIG1108C - Intro to Programming with PHP](http://vcc-dig1108.github.io/) | [(github)](https://github.com/vcc-dig1108/)\r\n* [Just Enough Academy](http://justenoughacademy.com/) | [(github)](https://github.com/just-enough-academy/)\r\n\r\n### Some open source projects I have contributed to:\r\n\r\n* [php-activerecord](http://www.phpactiverecord.org/) | [(github)](https://github.com/jpfuentes2/php-activerecord)\r\n* [oauthlib](https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) | [(github)](https://github.com/idan/oauthlib)\r\n* [requests-oauthlib](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.org/) | [(github)](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib)\r\n\r\n### Interesting nerd facts about me:\r\n\r\n#### `vim` or `emacs`?\r\n\r\nI prefer `vim` in almost all occasions. See [vimium](http://j.mp/1ktN7Xi), [pocketvim](http://j.mp/1ktNm4P), etc. Learning `vim` mnemonics (I use the term loosely) requires a steep initial learning curve, however. For demonstration purposes, I defer to `emacs`-style editors like [Sublime Text](http://j.mp/1ktNH7t) or [TextMate](http://j.mp/1ktNIZ0).\r\n\r\n#### Tabs or spaces?\r\n\r\nI prefer spaces unless the project uses tabs. I currently prefer two (2) spaces per indent. When teaching, I will typically use four (4) spaces per indent in PHP and Python and two (2) spaces per indent for JavaScript, HTML, and Ruby, owing to generally accepted language standards. Drupal makes me cry...\r\n\r\n#### Drupal, Wordpress, or something else?\r\n\r\nThis site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) because it's hosted as a Github repo. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Is `random(X)` better than `random(X)` for `X = \"javascript php python ruby\"`...?\r\n\r\nAn interesting game. The only winning move is not to play.\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\r\n<noscript><small><em>JavaScript?
