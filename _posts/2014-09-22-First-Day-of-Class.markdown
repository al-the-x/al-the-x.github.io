### Today was the first day of class at The Iron Yard Orlando...

We have [14 eager students](https://github.com/orgs/TheIronYard--Orlando/teams/fee-2014-fall) who all arrived _ahead_ of time, setup their laptops -- for some, brand new, shiny machines they've never touched -- and sat attentively to get started. It was very encouraging to walk into the class and watch it happen, and I was grateful to have [Eric](https://twitter.com/ericdodds) on-site to run down the kick-off. After a little logistical dissertation by [Sarah](https://twitter.com/thebadri), we got right into it.

I started the day with an Agile ritual: the Standup Meeting. We all gathered in a circle around the couches and answered three simple questions, rapid-fire:

* What did you work on yesterday?
* What are you working on today?
* What, if anything, is in your way?

This took about 30 mins with 15 people participating, but it gave everyone a very quick check-in, "get in the game" moment. I think I'll keep it. I hope that, like on my Agile development teams, this will give Sarah, our effective Project Manager, a bit of insight into who might be struggling or falling behind as we go.

From there, we reviewed some of the prework back at the desks and started talking about Github. I presented the students with my "Back to the Future" analogy for Source Control and rambled around a bunch of other topics. I do better when I have slides, I realize; they help keep me focused and on-topic. Still, I feel that having too structured a lesson plan in this situation will probably wear me out. That's a _lot_ of decks to build!

The assignment I gave the class was to correct grammar mistakes in a few paragraphs taken from the [Grammar Quizzes](http://grammar-quizzes.com) website. In addition, I gave them [Try Git](http://try.github.com) and the [Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/) to work through in preparation for tomorrow. For now, though, I have them making commits through the Github interface. We'll get to all the `git` commands throughout the week.
