# **AL the X** is the unique pseudonym of [David Rogers](http://j.mp/al_the_x--about), a community organizer & nerd wrangler, instructional speaker, freelance software developer, and dad in Orlando, FL, USA.

> I help build the internet everyday using the power of my mind, a lot of typing, and copious handshakes and conversations. Swearing occasionally helps. I help organize nerds, run community events, and teach people. Sometimes I make money while doing it. Sometimes.

For more information about me, you can check out <a href="http://j.mp/al_the_x">the many public profiles of "AL the X"</a> courtesy of Bitly.

### Interesting nerd facts about me:

#### `vim` or `emacs`

I think in `vim`. See [vimium](http://j.mp/1ktN7Xi), [pocketvim](http://j.mp/1ktNm4P), etc. Learning `vim` mnemonics (I use the term loosely) requires a steep initial learning curve, however. For demonstration purposes, I defer to `emacs`-style editors like [Sublime Text](http://j.mp/1ktNH7t) or [TextMate](http://j.mp/1ktNIZ0).

#### Tabs or spaces?

I prefer spaces unless the project uses tabs. I currently prefer two (2) spaces per indent. When teaching, I will typically use four (4) spaces per indent in PHP and Python and two (2) spaces per indent for JavaScript, HTML, and Ruby, owing to generally accepted language standards. Drupal makes me cry...

#### Drupal, Wordpress, or something else?

This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) because it's hosted as a Github repo, but I regularly execute projects with Wordpress, Drupal, Django, Rails, and many other well-loved and heavily-disputed tools and frameworks. I tend to use what is best for the job at hand, regardless of the language... as long as it's OSS.

#### Which is better?

`return random(tech) > random(tech) for tech in ("javascript", "php", "python", "ruby")`

> A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?
