<h2 class="summary"> I build robots that run your business while you sleep. </h2>

That's right. **I build robots**: _simple, easy-to-use computer systems that automate your key business operations_.

* **I'm a _software generalist_ with a _broad range of knowledge and expertise_**, so I can **find or build a robot that's a _perfect fit_ for _your needs_**.
* **I've worked _remotely_ on _distributed teams_, managed _off-shore teams_ and been _embedded on-site_**, so I understand the importance of:
  * **accountability for deliverables and deadlines**
  * **regular, consistent communication of progress**
  * **face-to-face conversations for important decisions** and
  * **critical in-person handoffs**.
* **I've been teaching and mentoring developers _for years_**, so I can **guide and instruct _your team of developers_** or **help you _assemble your own team_**.
* **I've been in the industry for a _long time_** so I still remember how to:
  * **manage your shared-tenant hosting**
  * **access your site via FTP or WHM** and
  * **maintain your legacy codebase**.
* **I've _stayed on top_ of emerging technologies and techniques** so that I can help you
  * **modernize and _incrementally improve_ your _existing_ robots**
  * **migrate _off_ shared hosting to the cloud** (if you need to)
  * **update or replace key pieces of legacy code** and
  * **educate your existing team on emerging best practices**.

### I've been building little pieces of the internet _since 1997_.

Using the power of my mind, a lot of typing, and copious conversations, **I build robots** that _automate_ manual, mundane, error prone parts of your business **so that _you can focus on what makes your business unique and successful_**.

For _you_ that might mean:

* _**publishing and tracking content automatically**_ so you can:
  * **locate and engage your audience**
  * **generate more leads** and
  * **convert more customers**.
* **building a robot that _adds a new, automated component_ to your business**,
* **telling you what _existing_ robots to _buy_** and
* **training _you_ on how to best use them to _grow your business_**.

I can even **select and train _your in-house developers_** so that **_they_ can build _more_ robots _without_ me**.
